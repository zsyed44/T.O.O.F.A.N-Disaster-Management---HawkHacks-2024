# T.O.O.F.A.N-Disaster-Management---HawkHacks-2024

We aim to use the tools found in this repository for the aid of mankind. Our goal is that our tools be used to help anyone who may be negatively effected, or even to get the oppurtunity to pitch our tools to a company with more capital. We think HawkHacks was a great event where we were able to express ourselves through our hard work, and is an excellent first step towards a new era of Natural Disaster Impact Mitigation!

The TOOFAN Rover:
	Our rover is a very simple design, A powerful all wheel drive bluetooth enabled car which has many features, and has potential for so much more! We have created a prototype model of this car, we aim to deploy our car into an area struck by either war, or .natural disaster. Our vision is to make this car reliable, and able to use the provided physical and AI tools to help people.   
   It can be controlled via bluetooth connectivity (we opted for bluetooth over wifi since generally WiFi towers are broken down in areas hit by disaster).
Remote Controlled: Our rover can navigate rough terrain and can withstand blunt force, all while being controlled by a bluetooth controller from an Open-Source app on your phone!
   AI Controlled: A feature which we aspire to add is AI controls, we have the camera and the radar, so in theory it would not be hard to incorporate AI Controls on the car in the event that the Bluetooth connection malfunctions, or even when operators arenâ€™t available to drive the car, an Artificial Intelligence Model can kick in and continue searching for and helping civilians.
   Other Tools On The Car: The following tools will cover all the physical, and software tools that the car possess (or will posses in an ideal model)
