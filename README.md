# T.O.O.F.A.N-Disaster-Management---HawkHacks-2024

We aim to use the tools found in this repository for the aid of mankind. Our goal is that our tools be used to help anyone who may be negatively effected, or even to get the oppurtunity to pitch our tools to a company with more capital. We think HawkHacks was a great event where we were able to express ourselves through our hard work, and is an excellent first step towards a new era of Natural Disaster Impact Mitigation!
